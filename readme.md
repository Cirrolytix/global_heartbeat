# Global Hazards, Exposure and Resiliency Trends By Earth Analysis Tools (Global HEARTBEAT)

Repository for Global Heartbeat

## Datasets

Global HEARTBEAT is an interactive web-portal aimed at providing geo-located information on natural and human hazards surrounding the communities of the Philippines and Canada.

Using the tool, users will be able to overlay various satellite layers against socio-economic data gathered by our researchers. 

We came together as a team by sharing experiences in social impact. Personal relevance played a big role in choosing our particular action plan. Members of the team have knowledge or previously worked on COVID research, agricultural development, risk assessment and disaster response.

## Planet With People

Satellite data is a rich source of information on our communities. Detailed satellite mapping has been accomplished through the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), but much of this information is unknown to researchers and inaccessible to people without specialized tools and training. 

We are a team from Canada and the Philippines and our mission is to develop an interface to present SEDAC data in a way that can be of tremendous value to users. 

## Our Solution

![The Solution](https://github.com/Cirrolytix/global_heartbeat/blob/master/images/solution.png)

Global HEARTBEAT is an interactive web-portal aimed at providing geo-located information on natural and human hazards surrounding the communities of the Philippines and Canada. Using the tool, users will be able to overlay various satellite layers against socio-economic data gathered by our researchers. 

## How It Works

We combine the NASA SEDAC data with relevant socio-economic statistics. Using the INFORM framework of EU JRC, we present a risk-based information portal on Philippines and Canadian communities.

By overlaying socio-economic data with satellite maps, users can be provided with additional ideas on disaster resilience, sustainable community development, and in general is an excellent educational resource on the diversity of our communities.
