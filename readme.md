# Global Hazards, Exposure and Resiliency Trends By Earth Analysis Tools (Global HEARTBEAT)

Repository for Global Heartbeat

## Datasets

Global HEARTBEAT is an interactive web-portal aimed at providing geo-located information 
on natural and human hazards surrounding the communities of the Philippines and Canada.

Using the tool, users will be able to overlay various satellite layers 
against socio-economic data gathered by our researchers. 

We came together as a team by sharing experiences in social impact.
Personal relevance played a big role in choosing our particular action plan.
Members of the team have knowledge or previously worked
on COVID research, agricultural development, risk assessment and disaster response.
